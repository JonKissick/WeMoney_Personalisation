To help us stay accountable I share our progress every month 💰.

Here is our December progress….

We have had an increase in #NetWorth over the last 4 weeks 📈 💰!!

Overall we are $64214.04 ⬆️. This is a smaller increase than normal. Overall our share portfolio went down, as did our superannuation and hence a smaller growth this month. Buy hey, GROWTH is GROWTH 🙌.

Our landscaping is FINALLY done WOO HOO but we haven’t paid for it yet. However, our Net Worth will take a hit for the month of January when we part with $123. We will however have our home reappraised and fingers crossed we make the $12K back 🤞!

FOR REFERENCE:

✅ Short Terms Assets (STA) - Cash 💰

✅ Long Term Assets (LTA) - Superannuation, Home, Stock Portfolio & Bicycle (we are hoping to rent out our bicycle as another form of income, making it an asset)

❌ Liabilities - Home Loan & Credit Cards (which are always paid off each fortnight)

***STA + LTA - LIABILITIES = NET WORTH***

I see my SalfWorth account cannot be added for account tracking, which was one of the reasons we chose this app over rivals like Packetblack. Are the connection issues with brokerage accounts something that has been an issue since WeMoney’s inception or is this is a new issue that has come up that should be resolved shortly?

It can be STRESSFUL but here are some stats that might help:

• The S&P500 has gone through 38 stock market corrections since 1950 (declined by at least 10%)
•Historically the average return is 7%, including these crashes.
• Fidelity found their best performing portfolios from 2003- 2013 (during the GFC… 🌎) were from those who were dead or inactive.

Market crashes/corrections are normal and to be expected so plan for them by having your emergency fund sorted and hopefully learn to enjoy riding this wave of your favourite investments being ‘on sale’

My investment journey started August 2020 and only now am I really taking it serious in terms of researching and finding what more I can do to help my goal of becoming financially independent. I haven't put a timeframe on that as of yet - still trying to get through the first stage of getting my budgeting and goals truly set.

I have been investing quarterly since in sort of lump sums I guess on IG. All of which have been good investments, most of which are ETF's. I'm now further exploring re-investing on a fortnightly basis on Pearler

On the otherhand of investing, I have been in the process of purchasing my first investment properly for maybe 6-7 months now. It has taken longer than my agent and I were hoping for but given our current situation (in Sydney), it's understandable. I'm going into property investment with my mum due to low income but the one big positive I am taking from the journey/experience so far is we have our deposit 💃🏼.

I have absolutely loved reading everyone's post that comes by - the ideas and positivity coming from everyone is so brilliant and generous. I'm so glad I have found this platform and happy to be a part of the amazing community!!
